This is a list of valid hotkeys to specify in config.cfg.  I tried to make the hotkey names as
valid as intuitive as possible, but just to make sure heres all the valid names.

Home key = "home"
Delete key = "delete"
Insert key = "insert"
Page up = "page_up"
Page down = "page_down"
End key = "end"
