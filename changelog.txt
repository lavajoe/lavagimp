v2.0.0 (pre-release current development):
	Added gimp directory (default location of gimps.txt is gimps\gimps.txt, can change it to anything you want)
	Added config directory which contains a config.cfg file to config lavagimp, current options are change home key to a few different keys
	and change gimp file location.
	Added ability to change hotkeys, only like 6 currently, not sure if I should add every single key on keyboard or just the ones that make sense
	currently have most of the ones that make sense (to me atleast)

v1.3.2:
