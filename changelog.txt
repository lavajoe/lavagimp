v2.0.0-a2 (pre-release current development):
	Added a version number for development builds, the first build for lavagimp 2.0.0 is a1, the current one as of now is a2, sorry for
	any confusion.
	Added the ability to change all the current hotkeys (insert gimp, change mode, delete), right now its just a few keys but more are coming soon.
v2.0.0-a1 (pre-release current development):
	Added gimp directory (default location of gimps.txt is gimps\gimps.txt, can change it to anything you want)
	Added config directory which contains a config.cfg file to config lavagimp, current options are change home key to a few different keys
	and change gimp file location.
	Added ability to change hotkeys, only like 6 currently, not sure if I should add every single key on keyboard or just the ones that make sense
	currently have most of the ones that make sense (to me atleast)
v1.3.3:
	Fix random characters being added at the end of gimps
v1.3.2:
	inital release
